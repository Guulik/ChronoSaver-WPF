# ChronoSaver-WPF
Chrono Saver is save manager for the game The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild, emulated by Cemu for PC. Chrono - your save, your entire adventure.

Install it directly to the folder with Cemu.exe. It should look like this {yourPath}\The Legend of Zelda(folder with Cemu.exe)\ChronoSaver

I hope my little app will help you to manage or backup your adventures. Have fun!
